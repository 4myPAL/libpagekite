### A note to developers ###

Developers who wish to negotiate alternate terms, service level agreements,
bulk discounts, support contracts or have questions about compliance are
encouraged to get in touch with the authors.

Please be aware that IN THE FUTURE, some parts of libpagekite (code specific
to frontend relay servers) are likely to *only* be available under the AGPLv3,
not the Apache License.  If in doubt, please consult the copyright notice
present in the relevant .c or .h files.  This is a shameless attempt to
protect the business side of the PageKite project and encourage folks who
need lots of frontends to either negotiate an alternate license or pay us for
service.  We gotta eat!

Also, if you plan to launch a million devices that all rely on the
pagekite.net relay service, please let us know in advance so we can provision
accordingly.

Thanks!

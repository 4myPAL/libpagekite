This will eventually be a tight, fast implementation of the PageKite protocol
in C, suitable for high-performance or embedded applications.

## What is PageKite? ##

PageKite is a protocol for dynamic, tunneled reverse proxying of arbitrary
TCP byte streams.  It is particularly well suited for making a HTTP server
on a device without a public IP address visible to the wider Internet, but
can also be used for a variety of other things, including SSH access.
